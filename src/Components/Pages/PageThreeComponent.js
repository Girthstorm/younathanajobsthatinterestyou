                  <li>I believe NVIDIA is a huge innovator in the market and leagues ahead of competitors when it comes to their AI chipsets and all hardware</li>
                  <li>The Architecture of their facility is stunning. Apples circle is cool and all but this open floor plan triangular design is modern and shows complexity, its really cool, check it out!</li>
                  <li>I love their "Like No Place Youâ€™ve Ever Worked" stance. It is awesome to have a company policy where they say they wont fall back on policy but will instead do whats best for you and your family</li>
                  <li>I really appreciate their preventative care policy, its nice for a company to not only care about preventative care but also 100% cover the care in-network.</li>
                  <li>I love their diversity, its always great to have a safe and inclusive space for everyone and NVIDIA provides that</li>
